;;; A Thompson-like runtime.
;;; Our patterns are represented as machine code. The states are addresses
;;; in the pattern's code (Thompson's states were jump instructions into
;;; the pattern's code).
;;; Another difference: Thompson mostly didn't allocate registers
;;; globally (using self-modifying code to hold some of the pointers)
;;; and copied the next-states array istead of swapping pointers.
