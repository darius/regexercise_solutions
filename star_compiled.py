# This seems to me the most direct and obvious change to star.py:
# where star.py computed Antimirov derivatives of the current states
# with respect to the current input character, this code precomputes
# all of the derivatives that can possibly come up, building a table
# of them. Now the only allocating done at match time will be in
# collecting the states into a set; but this set could be represented
# by a fixed-size bit vector (which we don't bother doing here).

# But it's not the shortest and simplest code we could write: that'd
# be Thompson's algorithm. See star_thompsonlike.py.
